Fake Podule Headers
-------------------
To keep production costs down the podule ROM is sometimes omitted from the final product,where an interface is built-in to the main motherboard (and hence always present).
In such cases the podule manager can be made to provide a fake podule header, and this is used for STB MPEG hardware and also for the EtherI interface on a Customer F Ethernet NC.

There are two ways to include the fake ROM header:
1. Set FakePodule0 in the machine header file
2. Set FakePodule in the components file (passed in via the MakeFile)

If FakePodule is passed in from the MakeFile it overrides FakePodule0 in the machine file.

The first approach is normally used, but the second approach is used for the Customer F 5 Ethernet NC where we use the same machine type as the Customer F 4 modem NC.
(The Customer F 5 Ethernet NC is very closely based on the Customer F 4 modem NC.
We don't want to introduce a new machine type as that would lead to other complications and make it more difficult to develop the Ethernet and Modem versions in tandem.)
