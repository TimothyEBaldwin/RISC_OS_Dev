RISC OS Open Release Archive
============================

This is the standard HardDisc4 disc image. It is a
bleeding-edge build which comes from the latest revisions of all the relevant
sources in our source code repository and is completely untested.

The disc image includes the universal boot sequence (!Boot application), when
used with versions of the operating system prior to RISC OS 5 you will need 
to merge some extra modules into the !System application, these are already
present in the RISC OS 5 ROM. The !System application is available as a 
separate download.

Some components in this archive are released under the licence (included in
this archive as Licence_v1_1.pdf), or see:
