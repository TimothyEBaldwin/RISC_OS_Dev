RISC OS Open Release Archive
============================

This is the IYONIX (codename Tungsten) development ROM image. It represents
the last ROOL build of the IYONIX ROM image, but does not always
correspond with a formal ROM release. Because ROOL don't perform regular
builds and testing of ROM releases, this ROM is likely to contain components
which are quite a lot older than in the TungstenDev build.

You MUST NOT attempt to program this into the flash of your IYONIX - even
softloading it should only be done if you are confident that you know what
you are doing and have a good backup strategy in place!

Some components in this archive are released under the licence (included in
