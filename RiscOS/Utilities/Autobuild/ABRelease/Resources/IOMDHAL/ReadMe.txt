RISC OS Open Release Archive
============================

This is the IOMD (A7000 and RiscPC) development ROM image. It is a
bleeding-edge build which comes from the latest revisions of all the relevant
sources in our source code repository and is completely untested.

Softloading this ROM image should only be done if you are confident that you
know what you are doing and have a good backup strategy in place! It is
likely to be incomplete and only partially functional.

Some components in this archive are released under the licence (included in
this archive as Licence_v1.pdf), or see:
