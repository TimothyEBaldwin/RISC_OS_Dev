# Makefile fragment for assembler modules targetted at RAM, built using objasm

INCLUDED_RAMMODULE = YES

#
# $Id$
#
# This makefile provides the following phony targets:
#
#    all     install_ram
#
#
# This fragment uses the following macros set by the master makefile.
#
#
# COMPONENT        (the name of the component)
# TARGET           (leafname of component being built)
# RAM_OBJS         (component's object files for romming)
# RAM_LIBS         (libraries to link again RAM_OBJS to generate RAM_MODULE)
# DIRS     (opt)   (magic target to ensure object directories are present)
#
#
# It relies on the following from the build system:
#
#
# INSTDIR          (installation directory for RAM_MODULE)
#
#
# It relies on the following generic tool macros from the Tools makefile
#
# CP + CPFLAGS     (copy, cp etc.)
# MKDIR            (cdir/mkdir -p)
# ECHO
# LD + LDFLAGS     (linker)
# LDRAMFLAGS       (more linker flags)
# MODSQZ +
#   MODSQZFLAGS    (module squeezer)
#

#
