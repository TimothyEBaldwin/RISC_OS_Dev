                        !EraseCVS
                        =========

EraseCVS removes version control information from amongst source
directories. Originally written for the Concurrent Version System
it actually removes
* CVS directories and /cvstag files
* Git directories /git and /gitattributes and /gitignore files

EraseCVS will ask you if it detects the directory dropped on
resides on NFS. This is intended to prevent people accidentally
destroying their real CVS sandbox (which is typically not on the
RISC OS computer that editing is done).
  
It can also be used from the command line.  Ensure !EraseCVS has
been seen by the Filer and then use 'EraseCVS' in your !MkClean
or whatever, or 'EraseCVS adfs::4.$.Project' etc.
