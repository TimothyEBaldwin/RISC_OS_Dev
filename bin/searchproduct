# Script used to search for a specific product in the modules file.
# It reports the revision of the products file that contains the product.
#
# This script is useful to find out what build a product was included on.
# The script is slow because it has to get every version of the modules
# file and search for the product in that version.
# 
# To run it you must be in the same directory as the modules file.
