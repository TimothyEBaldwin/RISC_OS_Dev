=head1 NAME

reposls - List the files in the repository for the current 'sandbox'

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<reposls>

Command takes no arguments

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Performs B<cvs log -R> in the current directory and reformat output so
it is a bit more readable.  Effectively this performs B<ls> (or B<dir>
for DOSaholics) in the repository.

What is the point of this?  Well, you can compare the contents of the
repository with your local 'sandbox' if you want.  Since the output
includes files which are in the Attic, you can use it to check on files
which you have otherwise no way of knowing if they even exist.
